Adding block map for size 0
Initiating full world-stop collection 1 after 0 allocd bytes
0 bytes in heap blacklisted for interior pointers
--> Marking for collection 1 after 0 allocd bytes + 0 wasted bytes
Found new system malloc AllocationBase at 0x2010000
Collection 0 reclaimed 0 bytes ---> heapsize = 262144 bytes
World-stopped marking took 47 msecs
Bytes recovered before sweep - f.l. count = 0
Immediately reclaimed 0 bytes in heap of size 262144 bytes
0 (atomic) + 0 (composite) collectable bytes in use
Finalize + initiate sweep took 0 + 31 msecs
Complete collection took 94 msecs
